### Hi there, I'm Alex 👋

I'm based in London, and I've been passionate about software engineering since 2014, turning professional in the summer of 2016. I have a deep love for algorithms, and you'll find some of my coolest projects here on my GitHub.

Lately, I've been diving into math and machine learning, and I'm proud to have my work published in prestigious venues like CVPR and IJCAI. Despite my focus on ML, I haven't left my Android development roots behind, as it's been a significant part of my career. I have a soft spot for C++ and low-level programming, enjoying the intricacies and challenges they bring.

When I'm not coding, you can find me behind the lens, indulging in my passion for photography.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to connect or collaborate!
